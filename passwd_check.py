# Homework:
# 1. Add functionality that tells the user exactly what they are missing to make their password
# stronger, such as symbols, uppercase characters, and/or more characters.
# 2. Add functionality that detects when a user adds too many sequential characters, such
# as "aaa", "111", and so on.
# 3. Check if the password contains digits as well to reach the 'secure' rating.
